      "description": "Asphyxia or asphyxiation is a condition of severely deficient supply of oxygen to the body that arises from abnormal breathing.\n\n An example of asphyxia is choking. Asphyxia causes generalized hypoxia, which affects primarily the tissues and organs. There are many circumstances that can induce asphyxia, all of which are characterized by an inability of an individual to acquire sufficient oxygen through breathing for an extended period of time.\n\n Asphyxia can cause coma or death."

      "description": "When you see two fighters down on the ground, they are each trying to get the dominant position. They will either use strikes to try to end the fight, attempt to get the other locked in an immobilizing hold, or try to get off the mat and back to a standing fight."
